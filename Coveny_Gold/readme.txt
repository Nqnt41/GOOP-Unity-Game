This is my final game submission, which I call G.O.O.P.

Overall I put just about everything I had wanted to into the game. The only real bug I simply couldnt fix was with the moving platforms - for some reason, no matter how fast I made them in the game editor, they would always revert back to a very slow speed in the game build. I didn't see this as too massive an issue, so I left it be.
Otherwise, I put simple tutorials on screen via text on the tilemap, but I'll relay the controls and important notes here just in case.
- Movement is done with the WASD keys and jumping is with the spacebar.
- Yellow buttons can only be hit from the top or bottom, depending on where they are positioned.
- Finally, colored nodes activate a zero gravity state via a force effector. Approaching them from lower sends the player higher while approaching higher keeps altitude relatively steady.

Let me know if there are any problems with my submission that make it impossible to play.
